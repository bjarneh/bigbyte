[ What ]

A small implementation of the Boyer Moore Horspool algorithm for byte
arrays for golang. Some stolen code from the bytes package is used for
testing.

For large byte sequences this should be able to outperform the function
bytes.Index, but it's hard to give an accurate measure of how much better
it will do..



[ Wild duck ]

I've made some benchmarks with the Henrik Ibsen play 'Wild duck', using
strings which are present, and some which are not. The entire size of the
play in terms of bytes: 278899

The strings contained are placed here:

    276159 - 99% into the file
     16573 -  5% into the file
     58757 - 21% into the file

+ 2 strings which aren't there.


[ Results ]

bigbyte_test.BenchmarkIndexBMH       500           3213600 ns/op
bigbyte_test.BenchmarkIndex          100          13757270 ns/op

Around 4-5 times as fast as bytes.Index, play size ~280K
